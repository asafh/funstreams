# funstreams  
This package will contain multiple stream utility classes in JavaScript. Most of these classes are useful only for object  with an emphasis on object streams.
Some examples:  
* Stream Demultiplexer - Splitting or "categorizing" a readable stream into multiple streams (that can be created on demand).
* SyncMap - array.map for streams, allows for mapping stream objects into new values while utilizing the Node.js stream buffer mechanisms to control consumption (of original values, and of transformed values)
* and mores 

Expect upload before April 2018.
